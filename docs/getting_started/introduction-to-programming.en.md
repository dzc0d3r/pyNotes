# What is programming ? ü§î

>Computer in the definition below is any device capable of processing code. To name a few this could be laptops,  smartphones, ATMs, a Raspberry Pi, Servers.. etc
## Introduction
So you want to be a programmer ? that's great üòä But before learning to program the first thing one can ask is what's programming anyway ?

A short answer would be, ‚Äú Programming is the act (art üòâ) of instructing computers to carry out tasks. ‚Äù

To be more specific it's the process of performing particular computations, by designing and building ==computer programs==. it involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, the implementation of algorithms is usually done in one particular programming language or more. usually referred to as coding.

## Well .. what is a computer program? 

A computer program is a sequence/set of instructions to a computer to execute.

In its human readable form it is called source code, the source code is usually written using a human readable ==programming language== such as C, Java, and Python. and needs another computer program  such as Compilers, Assemblers, and Interpreters to execute. that's because computers can only execute their native machine code (binary code.. Long sequence of Zeros and Ones ). it would be hectic for us as humans to write instructions to the computer in binary code, this is why high level programming languages exists.




## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs, and like human languages it's defined through the use of syntactic and semantic rules, to determine structure and meaning respectively.

Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical (visual programming language) like the famous [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}.  
Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and new ones are created every year.
