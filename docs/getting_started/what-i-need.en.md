# Let's talk about what you need ?

Before we continue forward together, let's talk about what you need :grin:. 

The first important thing is obviously determination and persistency :muscle: this is the case not just for learning Python or any programming language but for acquiring any skill in life, my advice for you is to never quit no matter how difficult things get. Have always faith and discipline .. learn and code everyday even if it's a little as a single line of code :innocent:  

## Prerequisites
After our little motivation speech let's discuss what prerequisites you need to start coding in python :


- Download and install Python
- Path Knowledge 
- Text Editor or fully edged IDE 
- Python VSCode Extension 
- Dealing with command line (Windows)
- Knownledge in Programming


> Although i'm using a Linux Distribution, i will explain exaplain the steps on Windows too .. for MAC users just go buy a Python Course lol :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: ... just kidding i will explain the steps on MacOS too :satisfied:


### Download and install Python

Obviously if you want to use python, you need python to be installed on your system.

#### For Windows users
Head over to the download page on [Python official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/){:target = "_blank"}, next click on the yellow button where it says Download python xxx, the download will start as soon as you click, next find the excutable and run it, an installation wizzard should open 



#### For Linux and MacOS users

In most cases Python is present on you system, just type the following on your terminal:

```bash 
     python --version

```





### Text editor / IDE
I highly recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target = "_blank"}, as it is a very popular coding editor used by millions of developers around the world, it has rapidly gained popularity among them, ranking as the most popular development environment overall in [Stack Overflowâ€™s 2019 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019){:target = "_blank"}. you can read more here on [why vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/whyvscode){:target = "_blank"}.


#### Installation proccess on Windows
 To install vscode on Windows just head over to [VS Code Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target = "_blank"} and download the version compatible with your system, the installation proccess on windows is staight forward like installing any programm, just keep hitting next button and finally finish.
