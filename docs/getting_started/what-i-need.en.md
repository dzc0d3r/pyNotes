# Let's talk about what you need ?

Before we continue forward together, let's talk about what you need :grin:. 

The first important thing is obviously determination and persistency :muscle: this is the case not just for learning Python or any programming language but for acquiring any skill in life, my advice for you is to never quit no matter how difficult things get. Have always faith and discipline .. learn and code everyday even if it's a little as a single line of code :innocent:
