# Meet the amazing Python :sunglasses:

## Brief Description
Python is an open source, interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.

Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today. 

## The Creator
One of the amazing features of Python is the fact that it is actually one person’s work. Usually, new programming languages are developed and published by large companies employing lots of professionals, and due to copyright rules, it is very hard to name any of the people involved in the project. Python is an exception.. it was created by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum){:target="_blank"}, and first released on  February 20, 1991..

Of course, Guido van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself. The speed with which Python has spread around the world is a result of the continuous work of thousands programmers, testers, users and enthusiasts, but it must be said that the very first idea came to one head – Guido’s.

Python is maintained by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/){:target="_blank"}, a non-profit membership organization and a community devoted to developing, improving, expanding, and popularizing the Python language and its environment.

!!! info "Did you know?"

    The name Python comes from Monty Python. When Guido van Rossum was creating Python, he was also reading the scripts from BBC’s Monty Python’s Flying Circus. He thought the name Python was appropriately short and slightly mysterious.


## What can you do using Python?

Using Python you can do almost anything, including the following :

- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.
- Data analysis 
- Web development
- Desktop application development
- Automation, scripting
- Software testing and prototyping
- Mobile application development (not mature yet)
- Everyday tasks

## Why Python Anyway?
Now that we know what Python is, let us take a look at some of its key features of Python: 

- Open Source And Free.
- Cross platform meaning it can run on Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc
- Simple syntax similar to the English language 
- Dynamically typed language, no need to declare the data types of the variables.
- Large standard library, it offers a huge standard library to its users
- Large community support with one of the biggest communities on StackOverflow and Meetup
- Interpreted, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Support for procedural way, object-oriented way, and functional way.
- Extensible and embeddable, 
- Easy To Learn
