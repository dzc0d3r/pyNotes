## What is Zen ? 
Before talking about the zen of python.. let's first get an idea on what is Zen.

Zen is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty and then spread to Korea, Japan, and other parts of East Asia. Zen emphasizes the practice of meditation and direct insight into one's true nature or Buddha-nature.

Zen is often associated with the practice of zazen, a type of seated meditation that involves focusing one's attention on the breath and letting go of thoughts and distractions. The goal of Zen practice is to achieve enlightenment, which is often described as a state of deep understanding and peace that transcends ordinary dualistic thinking.

Zen teachings often make use of paradoxical sayings, known as koans, which are intended to break down the limitations of conceptual thinking and stimulate direct insight.

## The Zen of Python

Now let's go back to Python.

The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 "guiding principles" for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language.

[Tim Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Peters_(software_engineer)){:target = "_blank"} wrote this set of principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999. Peters's list left open a 20th principle "for Guido to fill in", referring to [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum){:target = "_blank"}, the original author of the Python language. The vacancy for a 20th principle has not been filled.

Peters's Zen of Python was included as entry number 20 in the language's official [Python Enhancement Proposals](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/){:target = "_blank"} and was released into the public domain.

It is also included as an [Easter egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(software)){:target = "_blank"} in the Python interpreter, where it can be displayed by entering `#!python import this`
 
These principles encourage Python developers to prioritize readability, simplicity, and consistency in their code, and to strive for code that is easy to understand and maintain. By following these principles, Python developers can create code that is not only effective and efficient, but also elegant and easy to work with.

### The Principles

Here is the complete list of the principles :

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.[a]
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than right now.[b]
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea ‚Äì let's do more of those!
